<h5><center>"Solitaire" by Alice Oseman is a contemporary young adult novel that follows the story of Tori Spring, a disillusioned and introverted teenager who struggles with her view of the world. As she navigates through her school life, she encounters an enigmatic group called "Solitaire," who begins to cause disruptions at her school. Tori's journey delves into themes of mental health, friendship, and self-discovery. Although the book emphasizes that it is "not a love story," relationships and connections play a central role in the emotional depth of the narrative. </center></h5>
