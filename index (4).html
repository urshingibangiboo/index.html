<h5><center>"Sorrow and Bliss" by Meg Mason is a darkly funny and deeply emotional novel about mental illness, relationships, and self-discovery. The story revolves around Martha, a woman in her 40s, whose life unravels due to a long-standing but undiagnosed mental health condition. The book explores how this illness affects her relationships, particularly her marriage, her family, and her sense of self.
It's a poignant portrayal of how mental health issues can shape one's life and the complex dynamics of love, marriage, and personal identity. The tone balances sorrow with moments of humor and insight, making it a compelling, nuanced read. </center></h5>
